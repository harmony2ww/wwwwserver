# Security Policy
With using of web server opposite of variants to make demage must to know the dev 
version is a dev version of a source code. With developing source code one of a target
is to be secure not only when we using anybody source code, but be secure when using
our product of developing. With develop security must expect only updated variant 
of a source code or last year release be created us secure.Creating security must make
strong principles of all aspects when be variant of incorrect source code release.Inside
developing of a source code not only a programmer oppinion about the product is a strong
there are much of these directions that we could speak about hard secure. There are 
directions:

 * ISP
 * diferent levelvs of internet service providers.
 * Web hosting
 * Providers of a services.

Obviously main target of all security points is a good reason, that implements an idea
of be secure - may I close a back, that everybay wish to this option.
"Close about is there are full secure?"
Of a good secure I could speaking about a time period like it is secure about 10 years
or 15 years. In this case of cource our point of view is upto source code and it's mainteance
of it is. Good on.  



## Full life cyrcle about security is most common thing to success.
 Its a direction point to point with much of these obviously aspects of depends.

## What depend of developer of source code?

### Full life cyrcle of a security over source code is a right, common and base point of view about success.
All aspects and variants of systems that are close in contact with a source code could be integrate inside 
of an idea about full-life-cyrcle security of a source code. 
It's not enough to made a full secure open  source code maybe not enough and it is very much complicated 
in this situation can say secure code. And to create variants to be full secure.
Otherwise could there be much lose of these. 


## Supported Versions
All versions are with status testing.



## Reporting a Vulnerability
