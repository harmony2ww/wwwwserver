WwwwServer is high speed, secure and stable web server. Includes inside html, htm, txt, xml, php5, php7.0, php7.4, php8.0 rending of all. 
There are possible communication with GET, POST variable about more capabilities. Includes capabilities about fast optimization and testing of all aspects on web developing.
More stable than ever and secure, of course.

## Open Source 

It's only open source.  [![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/atomic-design-ui.svg?)](https://github.com/X0xx-1110/WWWW-Server/blob/main/LICENSE)

#### More than a web server 

## Getting Started [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ansicolortags/badge/?version=latest)](http://ansicolortags.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)

1. When you are ready about starting new web server you must to specify number of the port, that will.
2. Then must  to specify and directory about your web files. Where are they?
3. These things you could done inside file web_server.php at the end.
4. Be careful within directory, you could browse in files only if there are in.

## SECURITY 

### About first secure property -  (array) $securityArray .

These characters are excluded about the url and there get console error.

### About second secure property -  (array) $securityFilesWeb

These strings of file names are possible variants about started file into url,
else there are console error.


## Starting

```php
$server = new WwwwServer();
$server->httpServer(8282, "/home/XXXX/Desktop/www1/" );
```

### *** And Of course if you made changes over web_server.php you need to restart it into terminal again.
### *** It is a web server!


## Running the tests

```bash
sudo php8.0 web_server.php
```
Then we get the web server on (http://127.0.0.1:8282/)

## Example: [![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde)
Inside your browser (http://127.0.0.1:8282/index.php)


## Example 2: If you wnat close security checks then:
```php
private bool $_securityArrayStatuses = false;
private bool $_securityFilesWebStataStuses = false;
```

or 


## Example 3: If you wnat to open files pdf, txt, jpeg or html you must to add exactly file to property:

```php
private array $_securityFilesWeb = [ "", "index.php", "index.html", "index.htm" , "aaaaaaAAA.jpeg", "BaBash.txt"];
```


### *** And Of course if you made changes over web_server.php you need to restart it into terminal again.
### *** It is a web server!


## Latest 

### [ GET ] ! :heavy_check_mark:
### [ POST ] ! :heavy_check_mark:
### [ GZIP ] ! :heavy_check_mark:

### Cache :heavy_multiplication_x:
### HEAD, PUT :heavy_multiplication_x:
### encodings :heavy_check_mark:

## Features

  * Further over all maybe there are variant and for parallel port usage.
  * Obviously the quality of code is more strong than else.
  * There could be the effectively common generated dynamically variables about HEAD.
  * The variables could be $POSTtextOfAll, $POSTtextCrapped, $GETpageNotFound, $HEADcheck, $HEADcheckAtNow.
  * There needs about dynamically port change and further work on it.
  * Get needs and variants about rendering, else with no case.
  * Least dynamically create and use encodings of a page may be are big, of course.
  * Possible about of course and SSL.

## Ideas and Target :sunny:

* Main goal is to create something workfull about our developing needs.
* In second case I will try to give more about what could be.
* Open source ideas - there get chance to give more, create more and develop more.
* There will be more interesting and helpfull features about the web server.
* Developing ideas is more complicated proccess, that give me a challenge for future work.
* Creating ideas, create open source, creating, developing.
